    <h3><br>
        1. Underneath Arches National Park lies a salt bed layer, which was deposited some 300 million years ago when the area was part of a inland sea. When the sea evaporated, it left salt deposits; some areas collected over a thousand feet of these deposits.<br>
        2. Durig the nest millions of years, the area was filled with debris deposited from winds, floods, streams, and oceans that came and went.<br>
        3. Over time thsi debris compressed into rock. The weight of the rock layer caused the salt bed below to become fluid, allowing it to thrust up and create domes and ridges.<br>
        4. Erosion went to work on the surface rock layers and ground water began to disolve the underlying salt deposits.<br>
        5. Water seeped through cracks in the weathered rock and ice formed, futher expanding the crevices and weakening the rock.<br>
        6. Eventually, the domes began to collapse leaving a maze of vertical free-standing rock walls known as fins.<br>
        7. Wind and water continued to assault these fins until they eventually wore through, and pieces began to fall away, creating the amazing arches you see today.<br>

    <h2>Why should you protect the arches?</h2>
    <h3>
        1. It is destroying natures art the had been in the making for millions of years.<br>
        2. There is a 500$ fine and 6-9 years of imprisonment for Vandalism of National Parks.<br>
        3. It won't make you famous, it will make you infamous.<br>
        4. Despite what you might think it's NOT COOL to destroy National Parks.<br>
        5. Although it might be one scratch, if everyone on the earth makes one scratch there will be no Sandstone left.
